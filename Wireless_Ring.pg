	=== Problems:
	* Finding a battery that is small enough to be placed onto a ring, but with enough capacity to power a transmitter for a reasonable amount of time.
	* Finding a miniature transmitter to be placed onto a ring, and with working range for about 10 meters.
	* Creating a prototype of [[Wireless Ring]], that is not too bulky and inconvenient to wear.

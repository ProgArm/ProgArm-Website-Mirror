text: * It must be useful, and this usefulness must be measurable.
	* Device must be easily extensible.
	** On software level:
	### It should be relatively easy to write your own extensions.
	### The only thing required to change the client code is a text editor. By using interpreted languages we can make it possible to edit the code as soon as you get some idea.
	** On hardware level:
	### [[Ring]], SPI and !I²C ports to allow pluggable modules, as well as solder pins.
	### Excessive hardware features. Things like barometer or accelerometer are not required for basic functionality, but they provide freedom of thought for developers.
	** All development files must be released under free software license. Besides boosting development speed by letting others to contribute, these files might come handy for other projects.
	* The less interaction required, the better. For example, why use both hands when you can use just one.
	* Device should not disturb you from daily tasks.
	* It must be safe to wear.

	Excited about what new features are going to be there in 0.2.
	
	Also i saw the device image so there's going to be ring thats Wired ?
	
	Don't you think thats a little bit inconvenient ? What if i'm on a bike and i accidentally fall off while the wire got stuck on the handle and from the pressure of my falling it would get detach.
	
	Also is there any L.C.D / L.E.D screen ?

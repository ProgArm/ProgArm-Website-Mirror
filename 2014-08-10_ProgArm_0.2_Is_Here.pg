text: We are glad to tell that the work on ProgArm 0.2 is now complete. The device hardware alpha [[https://github.com/ProgArm/ProgArm-Hardware/releases/tag/v0.2.0-alpha release]] can be found on [[Source|GitHub]]. Please note that there was a fix made to the schematic, however PCB files are still those of the previous version.
	
	By now, there is only one fully functional prototype. This prototype is working as intended, however it still has some [[http://progarm.org/ProgArm_0.2 flaws]].
	
	Second prototype is going to be built soon.

	Excited about what new features are going to be there in 0.2.
	
	Also i saw the device image so there's going to be ring thats Wired ?
	
	Don't you think thats a little bit inconvenient ? What if i'm on a bike and i accidentally fall off while the wire got stuck on the handle and from the pressure of my falling it would get detach.
	
	Also is there any L.C.D / L.E.D screen ?

	Yes, we are using the wired ring right now. As our tests have shown, it is a lot more convenient than it looks like at first glance.
	
	We are also thinking about a wireless version, where the main problem would be ring battery. We are currently thinking of tiny li-ion batteries or a supercap/ionistor, but the wireless ring is still just a concept.
	
	The micro USB type connector on ring wire provides protection in situations like you have described. When falling off a bike, the wire simply gets detached instead of getting torn off, and can be easily reconnected after you get up.
	
	Any type of LCD/LED screen that uses SPI/IIC interface can be connected to ProgArm using it's external interface ports. Right now we are not using any display, but planning to try using a small monochrome OLED screen.

	And thank you for your feedback on the LCD/LED, which i'm also sure going to be come ootb in the future ;)

	==Known issues:
	* One of the SPI port pins was not routed due to the error on schematic.
	* Ring LED is not connected to any TIM, which means that we have to implement PWM manually. This is pretty inconvenient, because hardware PWM can have much shorter duty cycle, therefore providing a possibility to have dimmer indicators. Also hardware PWM requires no additional lines of code to achieve different shades.

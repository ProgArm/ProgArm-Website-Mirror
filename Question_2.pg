blocks: <p>Just wondering, I was following the steps you outlined in your Perl Client on Android page and tried running the android_launcher.pl script but the editor window opens up the script with no launch. I'm pressing the "right turn" arrow to Run the script. Is that correct ? Also, it looks like the sl4a folder was installed on my sdcard. Is that where it's supposed to go ? Also, when I press the terminal button on the menu, all I get is a black screen and I can't type anything.

	**These are just some notes:**
	
	==Perl Client
	Currently there are only two requirements:
	# Perl version >= 5.10
	# Device::SerialPort
	
	===Windows
	Coming soon...
	
	===Debian
	Your Perl version should be high enough. Just:
	{{{sudo apt-get install libdevice-serialport-perl}}}
	
	===Other GNU/Linux distributions
	Install ##Device::SerialPort## from CPAN if your distribution does not provide a package for ##Device::SerialPort##.
	
	===Maemo (N900)
	The biggest problem is that Perl is too outdated (v5.8.3). You should install a newer version by using [[http://perlbrew.pl/ perlbrew]].
	
	Install perlbrew:
	{{{curl -k -L http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash}}} -k option is necessary, otherwise it will throw errors about https
	
	Install perl:
	{{{perlbrew --notest v5.16}}} tests will run for two hours if you don't disable them. There are many failed tests, but it seems like perl is fully functional anyway.
	
	Show installed versions:
	{{{perlbrew list}}} If everything went well, you will see ##perl-5.16.0##
	
	Switch to the newer version:
	{{{perlbrew switch perl-5.16.0}}}
	
	Install cpanm:
	{{{perlbrew install-cpanm}}}
	
	Install ##Device::SerialPort##
	{{{cpan --no-wget --verbose Device::SerialPort}}}
	
	====Sometimes you will have to provide full path to some binaries:
	perlbrew is located at
	{{{~/perl5/perlbrew/bin/perlbrew}}}
	
	cpanm is located at
	{{{~/perl5/perlbrew/bin/cpanm}}}
	
	perl v5.16 is located at
	{{{~/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.16.0/bin/perl}}}
	
	However, once you {{{perlbrew switch}}} to your new perl, you wont have to provide full paths.

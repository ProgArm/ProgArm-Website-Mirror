	* AT commands are different. For example, to change the password, you should send {{{AT+PSWD}}} to [[HC-05]] and {{{AT+PASS}}} to HM-10.
	* In HC-05, your AT commands are separated by \r\n. In HM-10, AT commands are separated by a delay (I have no idea how big that delay should be).
	* Command format is different too. With HC-05 it is like {{{AT+NAME=ProgArm}}}, but in HM-10 it is {{{AT+NAMEProgArm}}}.
	
	These are some minor issues, but it means that you cannot simply replace [[HC-05]] with HM-10 or vice versa.
	
	We have made a [[https://github.com/ProgArm/ProgArm-Misc/blob/master/bt_setup.py script]] that can configure both. It will detect whether it is HM-10 or [[HC-05]] automatically.

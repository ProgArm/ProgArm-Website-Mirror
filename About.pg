	ProgArm is a portable wearable device that is supposed to act as an interface between humans and various gadgets we use. It is based on ARM [[Microcontroller|microcontroller]] and a [[Bluetooth]] module, which provides communication with computers and mobile phones via Serial-Over-Bluetooth protocol. ProgArm also has some basic sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and atmospheric pressure sensor.
	
	ProgArm itself consists of a small 4 by 7 centimeters PCB, a battery and a [[Ring|ring]], which at the moment plays the role of the main input device.
	
	The [[Ring|ring]] is 3D-printed, with two buttons and a powerful RGB LED superglued to it. By pressing the buttons with a thumb in [[Controls|different combinations]], one can input various commands, that are either interpreted by ProgArm itself, or are sent via [[Bluetooth]] to other devices. LED is used as a notification light and also as a flashlight.
	
	Additional features include a vibramotor, a piezo buzzer, solder-on JTAG/SWD interface and two sockets for external devices. One socket port is for IIC interface, other is for SPI. The ports use widely-available micro-USB sockets and plugs.
	
	The list of existing and proposed functions of the ProgArm and information about clients for different gadgets can be found [[http://progarm.org/Devices here]]

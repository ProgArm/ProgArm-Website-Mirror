	ProgArm is a wearable device that is supposed to act as an interface between humans and various gadgets we use. It is based on ARM [[Microcontroller|microcontroller]] and a [[Bluetooth]] module, which provides communication with computers and mobile phones. ProgArm also has some basic sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, atmospheric pressure sensor, pulse sensor. It is also very extensible, you can add as many hardware and software features as you want.
	
	Basic ProgArm configuration consists of a small PCB, a battery and a [[Ring|ring]].
	
	The [[Ring|ring]] is 3D-printed, with two buttons and a powerful RGB LED. By pressing the buttons with a thumb in [[Controls|different combinations]], one can input various commands. RGB LED can be used as a notification light and also as a flashlight.
	
	The list of existing and proposed functions and information about clients for different gadgets can be found on [[Devices]] page.
	
	Please also see the list of our [[Goals]].

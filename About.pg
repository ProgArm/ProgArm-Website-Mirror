	ProgArm is a wearable electronic army swiss knife. It is based on ARM [[Microcontroller|microcontroller]] and has [[Bluetooth]] to connect with computers and mobile phones. ProgArm also has some basic sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, atmospheric pressure sensor, pulse sensor. It is also very extensible, you can add as many hardware and software features as you want.
	
	Basic ProgArm configuration consists of a small PCB, a battery and a [[Ring|ring]].
	
	The [[Ring|ring]] is 3D-printed. In the simplest form it has two buttons and a powerful RGB LED. By pressing the buttons with a thumb in [[Controls|different combinations]], one can input various commands. RGB LED can be used as a notification light and also as a flashlight.
	
	The list of existing and proposed functions and information about clients for different gadgets can be found on [[Devices]] page.

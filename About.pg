	ProgArm is a portable wearable device that is supposed to act as an interface between human and various gadgets we use. It is based on STM32F103 microcontroller and a Bluetooth module (HC-05 or HM-10 supported), which provides communication with computers and mobile phones via Serial-Over-Bluetooth protocol. ProgArm also has some basic sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and atmospheric pressure sensor.
	
	ProgArm itself consists of a small 4 by 7 millimeters PCB that is attached to a wrist, a battery and a ring, which at the moment plays the role of the main input device.
	
	The ring is 3D-printed, with two micro buttons and a powerful RGB LED superglued to it. By pressing the buttons with a thumb in different combinations, one can input various commands, that are either performed by ProgArm itself, or are sent
	via Bluetooth to other devices. LED is used as a notification light and also as a flashlight.
	
	Additional features include a vibramotor, a piezo buzzer, solder-on JTAG/SWD interface and two sockets, that enable connection of external devices. One socket port is for IIC interface, other is for SPI. The ports use widely-available micro-USB sockets and plugs.
	
	The list of existing and proposed functions of the ProgArm and information about clients for different gadgets can be found [[http://progarm.org/Devices here]]

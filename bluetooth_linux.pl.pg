	==Description
	This module implements serial port communication in GNU/Linux. Although it is called [[bluetooth_linux.pl]], it just reads from a serial port. Therefore you can use it with anything as long as the serial port is used.
	
	Like all other communication modules, it provides <subroutine>!InitConnection</>, <subroutine>Read</> and <subroutine>Write</> subroutines.
	
	By default, <variable>$!RfcommPath</> is set to {{{/dev/rfcomm0}}}. You might want to change it only if you are using other bluetooth devices and rfcomm0 is already busy.
	
	Please note that on most distributions you must be in **dialout** group in order to talk with serial ports without root privileges:
	{{{
	sudo adduser youruser dialout
	}}}
	It is possible that reboot is required after this.
	If you did that but you still cannot use {{{/dev/rfcommX}}} without root priveleges and the error you see is "Device or resource busy", then try to find out what is using it:
	{{{
	sudo lsof /dev/rfcomm0
	}}}
	If it lists **bluetooth**, that's fine. But if you see something else, for example **!ModemManager**, it is very likely causing your problem. Try killing it!

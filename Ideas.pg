	==Proposed ProgArm features
	* [[Alarm Clock]]
	* Smart alarm clock (recognize REM stage of sleep)
	* [[Timer]]
	* [[Stopwatch]]
	* [[SD Card]]
	* [[File Transfer]]
	* [[Encryption]]
	* [[Connection test]]
	* [[Ring test]]
	* Visualize data from accelerometer by using LED
	* Use master mode to communicate with multiple devices
	* Notify client about single-clicks. This is probably not useful, but it could be handy for custom modules.
	* Allow client to fake key presses on the device.
	
	==Proposed ProgArm rings
	|=Ring|=Description|
	|[[WinterArm]]|Winter glove with built-in ring|
	|[[Wireless Ring]]|Similar to normal Ring, but works without a wire|
	|[[CardiogArm]]|A device to control ProgArm via electric signals of human muscles|

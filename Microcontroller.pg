text: Currently we are using STM32F103RBT6.
	
	Meaning of the last letters:
	* **R** - 64-pin. [[ProgArm 0.1|Previously]] we were using **C** (48-pin LQFP), but it seems like it is not enough for ProgArm project.
	* **B** - 128 Kbytes of Flash. **8** (64 Kbytes) is fine too, but the price difference is pretty much negligible.
	* **T** - LQFP package.
	* **6** - operating temperature. **6** is good enough unless you want to boil ProgArm.

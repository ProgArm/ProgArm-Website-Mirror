	Meaning of the last letters:
	* **R** - 64-pin. [[ProgArm 0.1|Previously]] we were using **C** (48-pin LQFP), but it seems like it is not enough for ProgArm project.
	* **B** - 128 Kbytes of Flash. **8** (64 Kbytes) is fine too, but the price difference is pretty much negligible.
	* **T** - LQFP package.
	* **6** - operating temperature. **6** is good enough unless you want to boil ProgArm.
	
	You can find the description of other options in the [[http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/resource/technical/document/datasheet/CD00161566.pdf official datasheet]] on page 96.
	
	== STM32L
	We are thinking about using STM32L in the next version, but this is undecided.
	
	Pros:
	* Lower [[Power Consumption]]
	
	Cons:
	* Higher price
	* Less features
	* Less docs
	* Less popularity

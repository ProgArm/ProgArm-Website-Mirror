	Great News! I'm observing reduced latency in accessing the website not that it was too slow or anything before, just a bit faster.
	
	Feedback Regarding the web design:
	
	By knowledge i'm no web developer but i have been messing with some color schemes lately so here's what i have to say ,i think the total black background is not quite right, something like Zenburn would be nice (#dcdccc #3f3f3f if it helps :) ) and the green is ok but if you change the background you need to adjust the font colors too  so go for the base16 colorscheme.
	
	Check them out they are very popular and clean good color schemes:

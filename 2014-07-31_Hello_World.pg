	Great News! I'm observing reduced latency in accessing the website not that it was too slow or anything before, just a bit faster.
	
	Feedback Regarding the web design:
	
	By knowledge I'm no web developer but I have been messing with some color schemes lately so here's what I have to say, I think the total black background is not quite right, something like Zenburn would be nice (#dcdccc #3f3f3f if it helps :) ) and the green is ok but if you change the background you need to adjust the font colors too  so go for the base16 colorscheme.
	
	Check them out they are very popular and clean good color schemes:

	Yes, it is faster indeed. There were some problems with the server. Hopefully we will never see such latency again. :)
	
	I am afraid that if we go with gray, some people will disagree and suggest to use completely black background. And there are even people who prefer white backgrounds. We will never get it "right" unless we search for reasoning. Do you have any arguments for using gray background? Yes, there are some gray-background themes, but you can find some other themes with black background as well.
	
	The reason why I chose black is that the background itself does not provide any information, so I want it to be as irrelevant as it could be to my eyes. However, some elements have to stand out: buttons, edit fields and some others. That's how it is now on this website.
	
	What do you think? Does it make any sense?

	Shameful Rectification :
	
	Line 4: *think for the majority (not *thin)
	
	Line 7: *screen (not *skin)
	
	P.S there are tons of grammatical errors in my comments.

	Why don't you just edit your comments? :) There is one edit button at the top, another one is at the bottom. This website is a wiki, so any page is editable. Sure, there are some css tricks to make things look like they're special elements (like comments), but it is just a plain text anyway.
	
	Some of the markup rules are listed on [[Page Editing]] page, but it is hard to list all of them. What I know for sure is that it is never going to fit on a small bar of buttons. For example, there is a bar on stackoverflow with such buttons, but it barely scratches the full potential of what you can possibly do, so you end up reading the help page anyway. And guess what, things like //italics// or **bold** are so easy to remember that you don't even need a button.
	
	I don't feel like we should aim for "majority of people", instead we should try to attract programmers and just geeks.
	
	We will definitely try some other themes, but it seems like we would have to choose some compromise as the default and give an option for each user to select a different theme.

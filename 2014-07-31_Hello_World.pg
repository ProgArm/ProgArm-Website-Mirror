text: The transition to the new server is complete. Everything is set up and the website is nearly fully functional.
	
	You can find full source code of this website [[https://github.com/ProgArm/ProgArm-Website here]]. There is an additional backup for the whole content from this website [[https://github.com/ProgArm/Progarm-Website-Mirror here]].

	Great News! I'm observing reduced latency in accessing the website not that it was too slow or anything before, just a bit faster.
	
	Feedback Regarding the web design:
	
	By knowledge I'm no web developer but I have been messing with some color schemes lately so here's what I have to say, I think the total black background is not quite right, something like Zenburn would be nice (#dcdccc #3f3f3f if it helps :) ) and the green is ok but if you change the background you need to adjust the font colors too  so go for the base16 colorscheme.
	
	Check them out they are very popular and clean good color schemes:

	Yes, it is faster indeed. There were some problems with the server. Hopefully we will never see such latency again. :)
	
	I am afraid that if we go with gray, some people will disagree and suggest to use completely black background. And there are even people who prefer white backgrounds.

	Shameful Rectification :

	Line 7: *screen (not *skin)
	
	P.S there are tons of grammatical errors in my comments.

	Why don't you just edit your comments? :) There is one edit button at the top, another one is at the bottom. This website is a wiki, so any page is editable. Sure, there are some css tricks to make things look like they're special elements (like comments), but it is just a plain text anyway.

For example, there is a bar on stackoverflow with such buttons, but it barely scratches the full potential of what you can possibly do, so you end up reading the help page anyway. And guess what, things like //italics// or **bold** are so easy to remember that you don't even need a button.
	
	I don't feel like we should aim for "majority of people", instead we should try to attract programmers and just geeks.
	
	We will definitely try some other themes, but it seems like we would have to choose some compromise as the default and give an option for each user to select a different theme.
	
	I haven't tested it on different resolutions yet, so your font problem will probably remain for a little while :)

	A theme chooser would be really nice ;) 
	
	Ok so for the font size issue its looking alright in firefox but looking smaller in chromium here are some screenshots showing the difference:
	
	[[http://en.zimagez.com/zimage/2014-08-08-1740091280x800scrot.php|Chromium]]
	
	[[http://en.zimagez.com/zimage/2014-08-08-1740221280x800scrot.php|Firefox]]
	
	And thanks for the page editing link and i think that should go into a FAQ which should be added to the top for easier navigation.
	
	Also how about placing the links in the masthead in this order ? :)
	
	H̲ome D̲evices Sour̲ce  Recent Chang̲es Ask̲ About
	
	And why are there underscores in some places ? :O
	
	Some other suggestions :) 
	
	-A button for showing/hiding comments in posts like this which by default should hide the comments.
	
	-A masthead with shadows don't know what call it but its similar to the masthead of [[http://crunchbang.org|#!'s home page]]  
	
	
	-Some drop-down menus to make it easy for others to find content quickly
	
	-Also why no place the recent changes like a feed in the right with a button to show or hide ? ;)
	
	For now i only have these proposals/ideas until... ;)

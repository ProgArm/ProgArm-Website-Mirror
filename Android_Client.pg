	This client is not done yet. We are working on it.
	
	Here we will collect our thoughts about using [[ProgArm]] [[Client|client]] on [[Android]].
	
	= Introduction
	We want to put Perl interpreter right into **apk** (it is possible to compile perl for Android since v5.20). Then we will make a small layer written in Java that will let [[Perl Client]] run Android commands.
	
	= Status Bar
	It should show a battery icon in the status bar. This way you can easily track ProgArm battery along with you phone battery status.
	
	= Menu
	When you start an app, it will show a simple menu with these items:
	* Connect/Disconnect
	* Functions -- a list of things you can do with ProgArm (e.g. turn on flashlight, set alarm clock, turn off, start vibrating -- everything ProgArm can do). Every function in the list must display a key associated with it (you are meant to run that stuff by using a ring, after all).
	* Controls -- similar to [[Controls]] page (or even an exact copy), but right in your phone.
	* Status -- display various info (e.g. detailed battery info, uptime, etc.).

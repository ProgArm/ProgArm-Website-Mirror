	We are using HC-05 bluetooth modules. These are very cheap and easy to get, but they do not BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). 
	
	Since bluetooth consumes most of the current, it is very desirable to use BLUE to minimize [[Power_Consumtion]]. There is a claim that HM-10 modules are drop-in replacements for HC-05, but were unable to observe this. Although HM-10 indeed provide BLE, they are very different in functionality. Furthermore, they are not compatible with Bluetooth 2.0 devices (which happens to be the most popular version among bluetooth dongles). For now we advice to stick with HC-05.

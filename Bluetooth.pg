	==nRF8001
	<notimplemented>
	nRF8001 is not supported yet on firmware level. We are currently testing it.
	
	nRF8001 is built into [[ProgArm 0.3]], there is no extra configuration needed.
	
	==HC-05
	HC-05 modules are very cheap and easy to get, but they are not BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). Therefore expect huge [[Power Consumption]].
	
	HC-05 was used in [[ProgArm 0.1]] and [[ProgArm 0.2]], starting with [[ProgArm 0.3]] we are using nRF8001 BLE chip. However, you can still connect HC-05 to [[ProgArm 0.3]] if your phone does not completely support Bluetooth 4.0 (or just BLE). Firmware supports communication over USART natively, so there is no extra configuration required (in fact, that is the only way to communicate for now).
	
	* Connect HC-05 RX to USART_TX (5th pin from the [[Right]] on the [[Bottom]])
	* Connect HC-05 TX to USART_RX (4th pin from the [[Right]] on the [[Bottom]])
	* Connect HC-05 GND to GND (6th pin from the [[Right]] on the [[Bottom]])
	* Connect HC-05 VCC to PORT_POWER (3rd pin from the [[Right]] on the [[Bottom]])

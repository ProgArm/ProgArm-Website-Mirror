	<undecided>Undecided</> / <todo>Todo</> / <done>Done</>
	
	==Defined improvements:
	* <done>Use newer and smaller barometer (BMP180? LPS25H?) -- **DONE!** (Using LPS25H now)
	* <undecided>Use combined accelgyro and magnetometer (MPU9150?)
	* <todo>Smaller bluetooth module (CC2541 with [[https://github.com/aanon4/BlueBasic BlueBasic]] or nRF51822 with [[https://github.com/pauloborges/blessed blessed]])
	* <undecided>Use SMD vibramotor. (But make sure that it does not get stuck)
	* <todo>Reduce size to fit into 5x5cm (4x7cm currently) to reduce costs. 4x5cm would be great!
	* <todo>Charge LED is disabled when the device is turned off. This leads to false assumption that charging is not working when device is turned off by hardware switch.
	* <todo>**Do not use rare components!**
	** <todo>Use bq24297[http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq24297.pdf] instead of LTC3566.
	** <done>bq27410[http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq27410-g1.pdf] instead of LTC2942.
	
	==Possible improvements:
	* <undecided>Add built-in voltmeter for self-tests.
	* <undecided>Add LED to indicate reflashing process.

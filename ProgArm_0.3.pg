	==Progress
	<undecided>Undecided</> / <todo>Todo</> / <done>Done</>
	
	===Current stage:
	== <done>planning</> -> <done>schematic</> -> <done>components</> -> <done>PCB</> -> <done>waiting for PCBs</> -> <todo>testing</>
	
	===Improvements:
	* <done>Use newer and smaller barometer (BMP180? LPS25H?) -- **DONE!** (Using LPS25H[http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/resource/technical/document/datasheet/DM00066332.pdf] now)
	* <done>Smaller bluetooth module with BLE support (CC2541 with [[https://github.com/aanon4/BlueBasic BlueBasic]] or nRF51822 with [[https://github.com/pauloborges/blessed blessed]] or nRF8001) -- **DONE!** (Using nRF8001[http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/download_resource/17534/14/46196215] now)
	* <todo>Use SMD vibramotor. (But make sure that it does not get stuck)
	* <done>Reduce size to fit into 5x5cm (4x7cm currently) to reduce costs. 4x5cm would be great! -- **DONE!** (4x5cm)
	** <done>Use combined accelgyro and magnetometer (MPU9250[http://www.invensense.com/mems/gyro/documents/PS-MPU-9250A-01.pdf])
	** <done> Use LPS4012-222L or LPS4018-222L instead of huge inductors. -- **DONE!** (L-07C15NKV6T and LQM18FN100M00D)
	** <done> Smaller transistors -- **DONE!** (SOT-723-3)
	** <done> 0402
	* <done>Charge LED is disabled when the device is turned off. This leads to false assumption that charging is not working when device is turned off by hardware switch.
	* <done>**Do not use rare components!**
	** <done>Use bq24297[http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq24297.pdf] with LM3668[http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm3668.pdf] instead of LTC3566.
	** <done>bq27410[http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq27410-g1.pdf] instead of LTC2942.
	* <done>Optional battery thermistor
	* <done>RTC supercap
	* <done>No "mode switch"?
	* <done>Less ports, more pin headers! -- **DONE!** (1.27mm pin headers)
	* <todo>Minimalistic voltmeter. (as ProgArm extension)
	* <done>Pulse oximetry (NJL5501R? TCRT1000? Si1142?) -- **DONE!** (Using Si1142[https://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/TechnicalDocs/Si114x.pdf] now)
	* <todo>IR sensor and transmitter system. (as Ring)
	
	===Testing
	* <done>STM32
	* <done>LM3668
	* <done>bq27410
	* <undecided>bq24297
	* <undecided>nRF8001 - works, but is not configured yet
	* <todo>LPS25H
	* <todo>MPU9050
	* <todo>Si1142
	* <done>Supercap
	* <done>Vibration
	
	===TODO in 0.3.1
	* Route nRF8001 ACTIVE signal.
	* Increase reset button threshold (it is too hard to reset the device without going into flashing mode).
